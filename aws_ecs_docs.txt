Description

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable,
fast, container management service. It makes it easy to run, stop, and
manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless
infrastructure that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services
or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a
cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-
premises) instances that you manage.

Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based
applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to get the
state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access
to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.

You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across
your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and
availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate
your own cluster management and configuration management systems. You
also don't need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
